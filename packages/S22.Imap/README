#Introduction

This repository contains an easy-to-use and well-documented .NET assembly for communicating
with and receiving electronic mail from an Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) server.

The source code and the latest version of the library can be be downloaded from the
project homepage at https://github.com/smiley22/S22.Imap


#Usage & Examples

To use the library add the S22.Imap.dll assembly to your project references in Visual Studio. Here's
a simple example that initializes a new instance of the ImapClient class and connects to Gmail's
IMAP server:

using System;
using S22.Imap;

namespace Test {
	class Program {
		static void Main(string[] args) {
			/* connect on port 993 using SSL */
			using (ImapClient Client = new ImapClient("imap.gmail.com", 993, true))
			{
				Console.WriteLine("We are connected!");
			}
		}
	}
}

Please see the documentation at http://smiley22.github.com/S22.Imap/Documentation/ for further
details on using the classes and methods exposed by the S22.Imap namespace. Plenty of example
codes are provided.
